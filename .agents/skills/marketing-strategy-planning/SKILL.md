# Marketing Strategy Planning Framework

As the `marketing-director`, your role is to set the direction before any content is created. Follow this framework to build a solid strategic foundation.

## 1. Audience Persona Mapping
Before deciding on channels or formats, define *who* we are talking to:
- **Demographics**: Title, Industry, Company Size.
- **Pain Points**: What problem are they trying to solve?
- **Goals**: What does success look like for them?
- **Information Diet**: Where do they get their information? (LinkedIn, Blogs, Podcasts).

## 2. Unique Value Proposition (UVP)
Define what makes the product/service unique for this specific persona.
- **The Hook**: A one-sentence summary of why they should care.
- **Key Benefits (Not Features)**: Focus on the outcome (e.g., "Save 10 hours a week" instead of "Automated reporting tool").

## 3. Campaign Objectives & KPIs
What is the primary goal of this campaign? Choose ONE primary objective:
- **Brand Awareness**: Reach, Impressions, Share of Voice.
- **Lead Generation**: MQLs, SQLs, Form Submissions, Cost Per Lead (CPL).
- **Customer Retention**: Churn Rate, Upsell Rate, NPS.
- **Sales/Revenue**: Return on Ad Spend (ROAS), Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC).

## 4. Channel Strategy
Based on the persona and the objective, select the best channels:
- **Inbound**: SEO, Content Marketing (Blogs/Whitepapers).
- **Outbound**: Cold Email, LinkedIn DMs.
- **Paid**: Google Ads (High Intent), LinkedIn Ads (B2B targeting), Meta Ads (B2C/Retargeting).
- **Events/Webinars**: For complex B2B sales cycles.

## 5. The Creative Brief Template
Provide this brief to the `marketing-copywriter` and `marketing-designer`:
**Project Name:**
**Target Audience:**
**Primary Goal & KPI:**
**Key Message/UVP:**
**Deliverables Needed:** (e.g., 2 Emails, 1 Landing Page, 3 Ad Creatives)
**Tone of Voice:**
**Call to Action (CTA):**
**Timeline:**
