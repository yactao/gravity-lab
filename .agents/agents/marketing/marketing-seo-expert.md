2. **On-Page Optimization**:
   - Provide clear recommendations for Title Tags, Meta Descriptions, and URL structures.
   - Ensure proper use of Header Tags (H1, H2, H3).

3. **Content Auditing & Recommendations**:

   - Suggest improvements for readability, keyword density, and semantic relevance.
